    description: "The Volkswagen T-Cross is the brand's smallest SUV, sitting below the T-Roc in the lineup. Launched in 2018, this subcompact crossover is built on the MQB A0 platform shared with the Polo. The T-Cross features distinctive styling with a wide grille, optional two-tone paint schemes, and a full-width reflector bar at the rear. Inside, it offers a practical cabin with sliding rear seats that can increase either passenger legroom or cargo space as needed. The dashboard houses Volkswagen's infotainment system with an 8-inch touchscreen on most models. Powertrain options typically include a range of efficient TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 95 to 150 horsepower, paired with either manual or DSG automatic transmissions. The T-Cross is front-wheel drive only, focusing on urban practicality rather than off-road capability. Safety features are comprehensive, earning it a five-star Euro NCAP rating, with available driver assistance systems including automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist."
